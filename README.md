# Hi, I'm Josh — Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst

🔒 **SOC Analyst | Blue Team Operations | Incident Response**

Building practical, job-ready SOC skills through hands-on investigations, detection engineering, and security operations workflows. I bring strong problem-solving, attention to detail, and clear documentation skills from my IT and business management background. My focus is turning telemetry (logs, alerts, PCAPs) into actionable decisions.

## 🎯 Career Goal

**SOC Analyst** — focused on alert triage, threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring.

I'm based on the Gold Coast, Australia. Open to remote, hybrid, or on-site opportunities in SOC analyst roles (entry-level to mid-level).
