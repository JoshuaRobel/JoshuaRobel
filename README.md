<h1>Hi, I'm Josh! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuarobel/">Cybersecurity Professional</a>

# 🔒 Josh's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a growing collection of hands-on labs, investigations, and SOC-style documentation focused on **alert triage, log analysis, network monitoring, detection engineering, and incident response**.

---

## 🧠 About Me
I’m building practical, job-relevant skills for a **SOC Analyst** role through structured labs and repeatable investigation workflows.

With a background in IT and business management, I bring strong problem-solving, attention to detail, and clear documentation skills — with a focus on turning telemetry (logs, alerts, PCAPs) into decisions (benign / suspicious / escalate).

- 🎯 **Career Goal:** SOC Analyst | Blue Team | Entry-level DFIR
- 🧩 **Current Focus:** SIEM triage, Windows/Linux logging, alert investigation, and escalation-ready reporting
- 📚 **Hands-on Practice:** Defensive Security labs, playbooks, and incident writeups

### 🔍 What you’ll see in my repos
- Clear lab objectives (what I’m testing)
- Investigation artifacts (logs, screenshots, queries, timelines)
- SOC-style writeups (triage → findings → IOCs → recommendation → escalation decision)
